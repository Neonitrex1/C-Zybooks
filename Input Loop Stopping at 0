create a loop that stores integers into an integer vector
stop this loop when input 0 is met
then most likely use an if statement that has a nested loop to output values less than 0 in reverse order
vector<int> listOfNum;
int num;
int i;

//Collecting and storing input while input is not 0
do {
cin >> num;
listOfNum.push_back(num);
}
while (!(n == 0));

//Outputting integers < 0 in the list in backwards order
for (i = listOfNum.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
   if (listOfNum.at(i) < 0) {
      cout << listOfNum.at(i) << endl;
   }
}
