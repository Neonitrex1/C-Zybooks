create loop that takes input until input = -1, do not store -1 into the vector
either start at position 0
or start at position 1
int numS;
int i;
int second;
vector<int> listOfNum;

//Collecting inputs till -1 is hit
do {
   cin >> numS;
   listOfNum.push_back(numS);
}
while (!(numS == -1));

//Just defining what the 2nd last integer for readability (Not including -1 in the range)
second = listOfNum.at(listOfNum.size() - 1);

//If the second last number is odd, list the numbers starting from the 2nd inc. by 2
if (second % 2 == -1 | OR | 1) {
   for (i = 1; i < listOfNum.size() - 1; i += 2) {
      cout << listOfNum.at(i) << endl;
   }
}
//Else start at 1st
else if (second % 2 || second % -2 == 0) {
   for (i = 0; i < listOfNum.size() - 1; i += 2) {
      cout << listOfNum.at(i) << endl;
   }
}
