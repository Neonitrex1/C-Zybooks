loop that sets each vector element to sum of itself and the next element except for last element
//i++ uses the value, then it modifies it
for (i = 0; i < bonusScores.size() - 1; i++) { 
bonusScores.at(i) = bonusScores.at(i) + bonusScores.at(i + 1);
} 
=======
subtract 4 from any element's value that is greater than maxVal
first run loop that that reassigns maxVal whenever it is less than next element in the vector
input 2 12 9 20 becomes 2 8 9 16
2 max, 12 greater - 4 
12 becomes next max, 20 - 4
